       Pre-Colonial Times
     </h2>
     <p>The Pre-Colonial Times was a time period that was filled with adventurous voyagers and intrepid explorers; pioneers in a new world with plenty of opportunity. There were many different groups, including the Spanish conquistadors and missionaries, the French fur traders, and the English settlers. Each group had a different culture and background, and each contributed to the modern ideals of America in their own way. However, all of these groups had one thing in common: a reason for leaving their established lives behind and traveling to the New World. For almost everyone who traveled to the New World, the reason for it was either Glory, God, or Gold. These early settlers lay down the groundwork for the nation that would become modern America, and their impact upon the modern American culture and society is undeniable. The three factors of glory, god, and gold compelled them to establish a new country where their values in each of these three ideas was an important part of their society, and the society today.
