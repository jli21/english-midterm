          One of the most important factors as to why people came to the New World from Europe was glory. Many explorers of the New World were motivated to bring power and prestige in the name of their country, and to go down as one of the most prominent, influential figures in history. The Spanish conquistadors were a great example of the desire for glory. Hernando Cortes and Francisco Pizarro are still remembered today for their exploits across Latin America and their conquest of the Aztec and the Incan civilizations respectively. Portuguese expansion into the New World prompted many other countries, primarily Spain, to aggressively colonize the New World. Later, european explorers such as Hudson, Verrazano, and Columbus sought to discover and claim land in the country’s name to obtain glory. The fervent rush for the land in the New World caused a myriad of different cultures and values to be present within America, and is the primary reason why American culture is so dominant in the world today. 

          One of the the important causes for the migration to the Americas was for pursuit of gold. Gold is often one the primary motivators of the human race, as securing money symbolizes power and establishes a social status in society. The fall of Constantinople in 1453 prompted many European countries to seek new trade routes, as it was the commercial link between Europe and the Silk Road that stretched across Asia for centuries. The desire for gold, spices, silk, and other exotic Asian goods spurred the Age of Exploration. The Portuguese sailors quickly established a eastward route to West Africa, where they established a trading foothold. Although Portugal did not hold an entire landmass, their strategic holdings of islands and coastal ports gave them complete control of nautical trade routes. In response, the Spanish started their own colonization project with Christopher Columbus in 1492. Recognizing the monetary potential in the New World, the Spanish built the empire for the gold and silver buried in Latin America. Like the Spanish, the French came to the New World with the desire for gold, but instead took advantage of the fur trade present in Canada. The desire for gold contributed heavily to our current culture today, and the United States would be drastically different if it not for all the Europeans who came to the New World for the desire of gold. 
          
          Another motivating factor for the migration of people to the the New World was God. God played a vital role in society, and many of the essential core founding principles of this country where heavily influenced by Judeo-Christian values. Many of the explorers of the New World such as Christopher Columbus were convinced that it was God’s plan for Christians to convert pagans wherever they were found. Emphasis on the importance of God was apparent through Alvaro Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca’s account of his journey, in which he attributes the he and his fellow crew members’ luck to “God’s great mercy” (DeVaca, 1542) Additionally, Europe was experiencing religious turmoil throughout this time period, and new religious ideas arose out of new leaders such as John Calvin and Martin Luther. In Europe, Catholic and Protestant nations frequently persecuted or forbade each other’s religions, and the Protestant Anglican Church had split bitter divisions among traditional Anglicans and the reforming Puritans. The seventeenth and eighteenth century experienced the birth of many other new religious movements, such as Baptists, Methodists, Quakers, Unitarians and many more. The religious tension in Europe convinced many religious minorities to come to the New World, where they could practice their religious beliefs without the fear of persecution. Many of the first English settlers were deeply devout, as shown in Mary Rowlandson’s account where she writes about the experience of how she could not “ but admire at the wonderful power and goodness of God to [her], in that thought [she] was gone from home, and met with all sorts of Indians, and those [she] had no knowledge of, and there being no Christian soul near [her]; yet not one of them offered the least imaginable miscarriage to [her].” (Rowlandson, 1682) 

          For untold generations before Europeans came to America, the native peoples celebrated the great bounty given to them by the Great Spirit. However, many Christians held bigoted attitudes to those who they viewed as heretics and heathens, and did not attempt to understand the faith of Native Americans, who they perceived to be as a savage, uncultured individuals. This view is apparent throughout the excerpt of Mary Rowlandson, where she describes the native as “roaring lions and savage bears, that feared neither God nor man, nor the devil, by night and day, alone and in company, sleeping all sorts together” (Rowlandson, 1682) The lack of understanding that existed between the two drastically different cultures contributed towards many of the conflicts that sprouted between the settlers and natives. It is undeniable that religion played an important role in the formation of America, and it is not a surprise that America is still a extremely religious place today.
